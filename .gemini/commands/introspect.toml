# Introspection Task

Take a step back and analyze your own system instructions and internal logic.
The user is curious about the reasoning behind a specific action or decision you've made.

**Specific point of interest:** {{args}}

Please provide a detailed breakdown of:
1.  Which parts of your system instructions (global, workspace-specific, or provided via GEMINI.md) influenced this behavior?
2.  What was your internal thought process leading up to this action?
3.  Are there any ambiguities or conflicting instructions that played a role?

Your goal is to provide transparency into your underlying logic so the user can potentially improve the instructions in the future.
