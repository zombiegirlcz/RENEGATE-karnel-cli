# Procedure: Updating Changelog for New Releases

## Objective

To standardize the process of updating changelog files (`latest.md`,
`preview.md`, `index.md`) based on automated release information.

## Inputs

- **version**: The release version string (e.g., `v0.28.0`,
  `v0.29.0-preview.2`).
- **TIME**: The release timestamp (e.g., `2026-02-12T20:33:15Z`).
- **BODY**: The raw markdown release notes, containing a "What's Changed"
  section and a "Full Changelog" link.

## Guidelines for `latest.md` and `preview.md` Highlights

- Aim for **3-5 key highlight points**.
- **Prioritize** summarizing new features over other changes like bug fixes or
  chores.
- **Avoid** mentioning features that are "experimental" or "in preview" in
  Stable Releases.
- **DO NOT** include PR numbers, links, or author names in these highlights.
- Refer to `.gemini/skills/docs-changelog/references/highlights_examples.md`
  for the correct style and tone.

## Initial Processing

1.  **Analyze Version**: Determine the release path based on the `version`
    string.
    - If `version` contains "nightly", **STOP**. No changes are made.
    - If `version` ends in `.0`, follow the **Path A: New Minor Version**
      procedure.
    - If `version` does not end in `.0`, follow the **Path B: Patch Version**
      procedure.
2.  **Process Time**: Convert the `TIME` input into two formats for later use:
    `yyyy-mm-dd` and `Month dd, yyyy`.
3.  **Process Body**:
    - Save the incoming `BODY` content to a temporary file for processing.
    - In the "What's Changed" section of the temporary file, reformat all pull
      request URLs to be markdown links with the PR number as the text (e.g.,
      `[#12345](URL)`).
    - If a "New Contributors" section exists, delete it.
    - Preserve the "**Full Changelog**" link. The processed content of this
      temporary file will be used in subsequent steps.

## Path A: New Minor Version

*Use this path if the version number ends in `.0`.*

### A.1: Stable Release (e.g., `v0.28.0`)

For a stable release, you will generate two distinct summaries from the
changelog: a concise **announcement** for the main changelog page, and a more
detailed **highlights** section for the release-specific page.

1.  **Create the Announcement for `index.md`**:
    -   Generate a concise announcement summarizing the most important changes.
    -   **Important**: The format for this announcement is unique. You **must**
        use the existing announcements in `docs/changelogs/index.md` and the
        example within
        `.gemini/skills/docs-changelog/references/index_template.md` as your
        guide. This format includes PR links and authors.
    -   Add this new announcement to the top of `docs/changelogs/index.md`.

2.  **Create Highlights and Update `latest.md`**:
    -   Generate a comprehensive "Highlights" section, following the guidelines
        in the "Guidelines for `latest.md` and `preview.md` Highlights" section
        above.
    -   Take the content from
        `.gemini/skills/docs-changelog/references/latest_template.md`.
    -   Populate the template with the `version`, `release_date`, generated
        `highlights`, and the processed content from the temporary file.
    -   **Completely replace** the contents of `docs/changelogs/latest.md` with
        the populated template.

### A.2: Preview Release (e.g., `v0.29.0-preview.0`)

1.  **Update `preview.md`**:
    -   Generate a comprehensive "Highlights" section, following the highlight
        guidelines.
    -   Take the content from
        `.gemini/skills/docs-changelog/references/preview_template.md`.
    -   Populate the template with the `version`, `release_date`, generated
        `highlights`, and the processed content from the temporary file.
    -   **Completely replace** the contents of `docs/changelogs/preview.md`
        with the populated template.

---

## Path B: Patch Version

*Use this path if the version number does **not** end in `.0`.*

### B.1: Stable Patch (e.g., `v0.28.1`)

- **Target File**: `docs/changelogs/latest.md`
- Perform the following edits on the target file:
    1.  Update the version in the main header.
    2.  Update the "Released:" date.
    3.  **Prepend** the processed "What's Changed" list from the temporary file
        to the existing "What's Changed" list in the file.
    4.  In the "Full Changelog" URL, replace only the trailing version with the
        new patch version.

### B.2: Preview Patch (e.g., `v0.29.0-preview.3`)

- **Target File**: `docs/changelogs/preview.md`
- Perform the following edits on the target file:
    1.  Update the version in the main header.
    2.  Update the "Released:" date.
    3.  **Prepend** the processed "What's Changed" list from the temporary file
        to the existing "What's Changed" list in the file.
    4.  In the "Full Changelog" URL, replace only the trailing version with the
        new patch version.

## Finalize

- After making changes, run `npm run format` to ensure consistency.
- Delete any temporary files created during the process.
